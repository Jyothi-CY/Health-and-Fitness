Health and Fitness

Overview
The Health and Fitness project analyzes and visualizes data related to health and fitness applications. It involves cleaning datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visual insights, such as graphs and word clouds, to uncover trends in user behavior and app performance.

Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessed raw datasets to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed insights and patterns using visualizations and statistical techniques.

Word Cloud Generation: Visualizes keywords in 5-star reviews of "Health & Fitness" apps, excluding stopwords and app names.

Graphs and Visualizations: Provides compelling visuals to support the analysis.

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks: Step-by-step analysis for replicable workflows.
